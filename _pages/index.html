      The Music Machine is your first-choice for a fun-fuelled event. With over
      11 hours of music in their diverse repertoire, your event is guaranteed to
      have wall-to-wall music for everyone. Between its three band-members, The
      Music Machine have toured Europe, the UK and have finally found their
      spiritual home in Switzerland. However, travel elsewhere is certainly
      possible to ensure your event is extra-special!
